## MaterialPass (Material Passport) `MTP` `mtlp`
**Advanced materials not only for Design but also for Simulation**

MaterialPass materials as digital catalogs not only hold [Physically Based Rendering (PBR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physically_based_rendering) textures/colors (Metal - Roughness) but also hold extra Data/Information like mass, weight, water consumption, etc, and anything we see today (or will see tomorrow) as `Psets` and `Qtos` in [Industry Foundation Classes (IFC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry_Foundation_Classes) and other schemas for “simulation” purposes

### Structure
1. **Material** - Materials that are _GIS/BIM/PLM/VFX-ready and globally registered once and can be used multiple times_
2. **Object** - Objects that are _GIS/BIM/PLM/VFX-ready and globally registered once and can be used multiple times_
3. **Product** - Products that are _GIS/BIM/PLM/VFX-ready and globally registered once and can be used multiple times_
4. **Facility** - Facilities that are _Smart Cities-ready and globally registered once and can be used multiple times_

In this way, we can decouple geometry and semantics

* Geometry - As we know there are many geometry (modeling) paradigms, which some are good for geometric visual representation, some for analysis and simulation, etc, so always different geometry paradigms is a significant obstacle in integrating different worlds, for instance, GIS and BIM, or BIM and PLM, or VFX and BIM, so on
* Semantics - Data/Information/Knowledge Units

This way can solve known challenges because they modeled once globally through the best paradigm for that specific use-case and are ready-to-use in different worlds that can be assembled together (geometry and data/information/knowledge units) like LEGOs

### Usage
1. Speed up System Dynamics and Circular Economy
2. Integrating GIS, CAD, BIM, PLM, CAM, VFX, XR, and other different worlds together
3. Better focus on Geometry, Optics, Physics, and Preception which will advance some areas like Computer Graphics and Artificial Intelligence (AI), projects like [PyTorch3D](https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytorch3d)
