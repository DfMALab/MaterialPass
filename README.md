# MaterialPass
Advanced materials not only for Design but also for Simulation

MaterialPass materials are advanced not only for Design but also for Simulation

MaterialPass materials as catalogs not only hold [Physically Based Rendering (PBR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physically_based_rendering) textures/colors (Metal - Roughness) but also hold extra Data/Information like mass, weight, water consumption, etc, and anything we see today (or will see tomorrow) as `Psets` and `Qtos` in [Industry Foundation Classes (IFC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industry_Foundation_Classes) and other schemas for “simulation” purposes
